# This Project incorporates React + ESRI JS

This project contains a map of North Carolina counties and population, createed from population data referencing 2010 population. Due to the geographic breakdown of the population data a custom widget was created to display the data for each county. However clicking on the map still shows the data broken down by the population desnity.
